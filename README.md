# DisarmTripwire

## What?
Forge disabled the ability to disarm tripwire by left-clicking it with shears. This mod brings that ability back.

## How?
It's very simple, the actual logic for disarmed tripwire is still in the game, so all I have to do is add an event handler to disarm the tripwire when left-clicking with shears.

**If you want me to port this mod to another version of forge then make an issue here.**
